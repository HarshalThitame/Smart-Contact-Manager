						What is a contact management system?</h3>

					<p class="text-secondary font-italic ml-3">Contact management is the best solution to track and manage
						contacts as it will present relevant information in a clear way
						which will help you work efficiently. Contact management is a
						database with names, addresses, phone numbers, emails and all
						information regarding your contacts. You will be able to keep
						track of every contact, update details regularly and view past
						conversations you had with customers from a single platform. All
						members of your organization will be able to access contact
						management system through a centralized interface and have a clear
						view of each contact. You will have a complete record of phone
						calls and emails, set follow-up reminders and can add additional
						notes in reference to the conversation you had with any contact.
						This will help you to up-sell or cross-sell to your existing
						customers by recalling what products or services they loved.</p>
